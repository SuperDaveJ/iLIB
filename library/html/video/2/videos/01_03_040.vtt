Answers under pressure, it's a hard thing to deal with as project officers. And you'll find this happened both on phone calls and at site visits. 

2
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:19.533
But I found that when I tell my grantee that I need a little time to really investigate, to get the right information, talk to the people I need to to be able 

3
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:28.733
to respond back to them with a solid answer, they will generally be fine with that. I also let them know when I will get back to them. 

4
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:35.099
And I keep them informed as I am going through the process if there's a delay or not. And generally things work out well. 

5
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.933
And I get the answer that they need.

6
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:46.399
I would let that grantee know that I would get the answer for them as soon as possible. This may be an instance where I need to review what the

7
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.700
rules are concerning providing meals at a conference. I wouldn't want to be pushed into giving a hasty answer. In that opportunity, you 

8
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.000
may say the wrong thing; so, I would let them know I will consult with the rules and then get back with them as soon as possible. 

9
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.333
But I wouldn't be pressured into giving an answer right there on the spot.
