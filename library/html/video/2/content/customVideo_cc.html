  <p class="b">My grantee is having a conference next month and wants to know if they can buy meals for people who donâ€™t get per diem. They want me to provide an answer immediately. He thinks since I am here on a site visit, I should give him an answer. How do I handle this?</p>
  
  <p><span class="b">Sarah Kuester, Public Health Advisor:</span> Answers under pressure, it's a hard thing to deal with as project officers. And you'll find this happened both on phone calls and at site visits. But I found that when I still my grantee that I need a little time to really investigate, to get the right information, talk to the people I need to to be able to respond back to them with a solid answer, they will generally be fine with that. I also let them know when I will get back to them. And I keep them informed as I am going through the process if there's a delay or not. And generally things work out well. And I get the answer that they need.</p>

  <p><span class="b">Vincent Fears, Public Health Advisor:</span> I would let that grantee know that I would get the answer for them as soon as possible. This may be an instance where I need to review what the rules are concerning providing meals at a conference. I wouldn't want to be pushed into giving a hasty answer. In that opportunity, you may say the wrong thing; so, I would let them know I will consult with the rules and then get back with them as soon as possible. But I wouldn't be pressured into giving an answer right there on the spot.</p>
